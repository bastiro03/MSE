Mocha CFW - The sweet chocolate to your latte!

Mocha CFW FE tries to be a combination of all forks of Mocha CFW.

Mocha CFW itself is a custom firmware, derived from iosuhax, which offers all features of iosuhax and some addional features without the requirement of a fw.img on the SD card.  
It also combines all current features of a custom firmware such as sysNAND or redNAND with signature  
patches into one application with a configuration setting.  
It allows homebrew to access the entire filesystem.
