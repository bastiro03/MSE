Mocha CFW - The sweet chocolate to your latte!

Mocha SE aims to combine the features from all Mocha CFW forks, plus some extra quality-of-life changes.

Mocha CFW itself is a custom firmware, derived from iosuhax, which offers all features of iosuhax and some addional features without the requirement of a fw.img on the SD card.  
It combines all current features of a custom firmware such as sysNAND or redNAND with signature patches into one application with a configuration setting.  
It  also allows homebrew to access the entire filesystem.
