## MSE
Mocha Second Edition, or MSE for short, is a project aiming to combine all Mocha CFW versions, adding some extra quality-of-life changes and features from all the different forks and releases.
## Mocha CFW
Mocha CFW is a custom firmware for the Wii U that is derived from iosuhax, offering all its features, plus some addional ones without needing a "fw.img" file on the console's SD.
It combines all features of a custom firmware such as sysNAND or redNAND with signature patches into one application with a configuration setting, and allows homebrew to access the entire filesystem.
